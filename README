The main file here is dorado.sh, which is a wrapper around dorado that rsyncs the pod5 files from the project folder to a local (e.g. scratch) and performs duplex basecalling. `dorado.sh <Project base>` will usually work, selecting the latest model by default. Sometimes the `report.md` file is missing the cell ID, then that needs to be added mannually with `-c`.

```
Usage:
  dorado.sh
run dorado basecalling.
  -d  Base directory from the MinIon 
  -c  cell (e.g. FLO-MIN114)
  -o  furhter options (such as "--device cuda:0")
  -m  model (e.g. dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_sup@v4.2.0)
  -p  pod5 or fast5, default pod5
  -h  show this help
```
